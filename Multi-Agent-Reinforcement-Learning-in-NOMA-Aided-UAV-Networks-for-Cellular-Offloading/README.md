1. This simulation code package is related to the results of the following paper:

R. Zhong, X. Liu, Y. Liu and Y. Chen, "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in NOMA-aided UAV Networks for Cellular Offloading,"
in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, doi: 10.1109/TWC.2021.3104633.

2. If you benefit from this code package in any way, please cite the original paper above. 
 The author in charge of this simulation code package is: Ruikang Zhong (email: r.zhong@qmul.ac.uk).

3. The code files are all in one scheme, and can be simpley run by hitting run buttom. The 'UAV-DQN-NOMA-NOTE2' file is for the NOMA
case and the file 'UAV-DQN-OMA-NOTE2' assumes OMA shceme for UAVs.

4. The version used for the last test of this code package is
python version 3.7.4
Tensorflow version 2.1.0
